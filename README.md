# Programming/Data/Computer Science Text Books

:wave: Hi, there! I've created this repository to be a place holder for all notes, exercises and code produced throughout my study sessions of computer science related stuff.

In each folder you'll find a structure similar to this:

```
ðŸ“¦book-name
 â”£ ðŸ“‚code â†’ This is where I'll keep the code produced in exercises and during the reading.
 â”— ðŸ“œBookNameNotes.md â†’ This will be the standard file name for my notes.
```

> There may be other random files inside the `book-name` folder and they're probably related to some misuse of the cwd in the exercises.

The books I've read to this moment are:

1. [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - Allen B. Downey](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)
2. Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People - Aditya Y. Bhargava
3. *More to come...*


Welcome to my learning journey!
