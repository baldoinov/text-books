# Text Books I've Read

:wave: Hi, there! I've created this repository to be a placeholder for all notes, exercises and code produced throughout my study sessions of computer science/data science related stuff or any technical reading that requires coding.

The books I've read to this moment are:

1. [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - Allen B. Downey](/think-python/)
2. [Basic Econometrics - Damodar Gujarati and Dawn Porter](/econometria-basica/)
3. [(Statistics) Estatística Básica - Bussab e Morettin](/estatistica-basica/)
4. [Deep learning with Python - François Chollet](/deep-learning-with-python/)
5. [Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn - Raschka, Liu, Mirjalili](/machine-learning-w-pytorch-n-sklearn/)
6. [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow - Aurélien Géron](/hands-on-machine-learning/)


Welcome to my learning journey!

> OBS: the language in the subfolders may vary. If the book is in portuguese, all my notes will be in portuguese too, otherwise I will use english
