# Text Books I've Read

:wave: Hi, there! I've created this repository to be a placeholder for all notes, exercises and code produced throughout my study sessions of computer science/data science related stuff or any technical reading that requires coding.

In each folder you'll find a structure similar to this:

```
ðŸ“¦book-name
 â”£ ðŸ“‚code â†’ This is where I'll keep the code produced in exercises and during the reading.
 â”— ðŸ“œBookNameNotes.md â†’ This will be the standard file name for my notes.
```

> There may be other random files inside the `book-name` folder and they're probably related to some misuse of the cwd in the exercises.

The books I've read to this moment are:

1. [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - Allen B. Downey](/think-python/))
2. [Basic Econometrics - Damodar Gujarati and Dawn Porter](/econometria-basica/)
3. Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People - Aditya Y. Bhargava
4. *More to come...*


Welcome to my learning journey!

> OBS: the language in the subfolders may vary. If the book is in portuguese, all my notes will be in portuguese too, otherwise I will use english
