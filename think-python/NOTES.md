- Tuples are an ***immutable sequence of elements***
    - Tuples can be defined in the following forms:
    
    ```python
    >>> t = ' a' , ' b' , ' c' , ' d' , ' e'
    >>> t = (' a' , ' b' , ' c' , ' d' , ' e' )
    >>> t1 = ' a' ,
    >>> t = tuple(' lupins' ) ‚Üí (' l' , ' u' , ' p' , ' i' , ' n' , ' s' )
    ```
    
    - You can use a list of tuples to create a new dict:
    
    ```python
    >>> t = [(' a' , 0), (' c' , 2), (' b' , 1)] 
    >>> d = dict(t)
    ```
    
- ***Tuples assigments*** ‚Üí an assigment with a sequence on the right side and a tuple of variables on the left
    
    ```python
    a, b = b, a
    ```
    
    - All the expressions on the right side are evaluated and then its elements are assigned to the variables on the left. It‚Äôs a more concise way to write:
    
    ```python
    temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
    ```
    
- ***Gather***: an operation that collects multiple arguments into a tuple. Usually, a parameter name that begins with *******.
    
    ```python
    def printall(*args):
        print(args)
    
    printall(1, 2, 3)
    >>> (1, 2, 3)
    ```
    
- ***Scatter***: an operation that unpacks a sequence of values as single ones. Using a function as exemple, we would have:
    
    ```python
    t = (7, 3)
    
    # divmod takes exactly two arguments. see [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod)
    divmod(*t)
    >>> (2, 1)
    
    # The same as using:
    divmod(7, 3)
    >>> (2, 1)
    ```
    
- ***zip***: a built-in function that takes two or more sequence and interleaves them. Returns a ***zip object*** which is an ***iterator***, an object that iterates through a sequence. Their difference to a list it‚Äôs you can‚Äôt use indexes to select their elements
    
    ```python
    seq1 = 'Vitor'
    seq2 = 'Baldo'
    
    list(zip(seq1, seq2))
    >>> [('V', 'B'), ('i', 'a'), ('t', 'l'), ('o', 'd'), ('r', 'o')]
    
    # If the sequences are from different sizes, the zip keeps the size of the shorter one
    
    seq3 = 'Casa' 
    seq4 = 'Gol'
    
    list(zip(seq3, seq4))
    >>> [('C', 'G'), ('a', 'o'), ('s', 'l')]
    ```
    
- Combining ***zip***, ***for loops*** and ***tuple assigments*** we get a useful idiom for traversing two (or more) sequences at the same time:
    
    ```python
    def has_match(t, l):
    	for x, y in zip(t, l):
    		if x == y:
    			return True
    	return False
    ```
    
- ***Enumerate***: useful built-in function to traverse the elements of a sequence and their indices:
    
    ```python
    for index, element in enumarate('Vitor'):
    	print(index, element)
    
    >>> 0 'V'
    >>> 1 'i'
    >>> 2 't'
    >>> 3 'o'
    >>> 4 'r'
    ```

- ‚Äú*Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random because they are generated by a deterministic computation, but just by looking at the numbers it is all but impossible to distinguish them from random.‚Äù*
- The ***random*** module also provides functions to generate values from continuous distributions.
- Optional parameters:
    
    ```python
    def print_most(hist: dict, num: int=10):
    		...do something using num...
    ```
    
    - This function has the default value of 10 for the parameter *num*. If we call the function as ***print_most(d, num=20)***, the 20 will override the default value.
    - All the required parameters have to como first in a function call.
- ***Markov Analysis:***
    - A way of measure the relationship of words in a text. It maps prefixes to suffixes and it is useful to generate a random text.
- The ***profile*** module can identify the places in a programa that take the most time.

- When referencing a file withou using its ***absolute path** (home_dir/parent_folder/file.txt)*, we are using a ***relative path***. That is, a path tha is relative to the current working directory
- The module ***dbm*** provides an interface for creating and updating database files. But be aware that the keys in the database created by dbm are ***bytes objects or strings***, and some difficulties can arise from that.
- A way of solve the previously announced problem is to use the ***picle module***, that translates almost any type of object into a string suitable for storage in a database. ‚Üí The combination of ***dbm*** and ***pickle*** is so common that was encapsulated in a module called ***shelve***.
- To run shell commands in python we can use a ***pipe object***:
    
    ```python
    cmd = 'ls -l'
    fp = os.popen(cmd)
    ```
    
    - popen is deprecated. We should use the subprocess module.
- Most Unix systems provide a command called ***md5sum*** that reads the contents of a file and computes a ‚Äúchecksum‚Äù

- A ***class*** is a programmer-defined type. A class definition creates a new ***class object***, that is, an object that holds information about a programmer-defined class.
- Creating a new object is called ***instantiation***, and the object is an ***instance*** of the class.
    
    ```python
    class Point:
    		pass
    
    blank = Point() # blank is an instance of the class Point
    ```
    
- Objects have ***attributes***, that is, values within them:
    
    ```python
    blank.x = 3
    blank.y = 4
    ```
    
- An object that is an attribute of another object is ***embedded***.
- ***Objects are mutable***
- Since objects are mutable. The module ***copy*** provides functions to avoid the erros caused by aliasing. The functions covered in this chapter where ***copy.copy***, which provides a ***shallow copy*** of objects and ***copy.deepcopy***, I guess the name is self-explanatory.
- A shallow copy means that objects embedded will not be copied.
- For instances, the default beahivour of the == operator is the same as the ***is*** operator.
- If you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute, you can use the built-in function ***hasattr***.

- ***Prototype and Patch*** ‚Üí a way of tackling a complex problem by starting with a simple prototype and incrementally dealing with the complications
- ***Designed Development*** ‚Üí a development plan that involver thinking about the problem deeply enough so you can come out with a simpler solution.
- ***Functional Programming*** ‚Üí a style of program desing in which the majority od functions are pure.
